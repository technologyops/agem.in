\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of this submission is to support a proposal to enhance education
 in government schools in Karnataka.
 We propose to do this with a an additional component of education delivered
 for 5 hours a week in Grade 6,7 and 8 in the first instance using the AGEM
 method.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objectives are to enable participating government schools in Karnataka
 to become the preferred schools in their communities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AGEM method relies upon wireless feedback response technology, pre-prepared
 topic plans with embedded questions, archival and analyses of student response,
 and real time graphical displays of class response for more than 100 students
 at a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The specific innovations are in the design of wireless feedback response
 technology, learning content, delivery methodology, feedback methods, and
 analysis of archived responses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a twenty year background to this work that has involved setting
 up two international schools, auditing international schools around the
 country, and working with children who find themselves in difficult circumstanc
es through poverty, natural disasters or HIV/AIDS in India, SE Asia and
 Vietnam.
 This is based on a twenty five year record of working in academia and serving
 as Visiting Faculty in tertiary education institutes in several countries
 including Singapore, Sweden, China and Australia.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Feedback technology and current usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Feedback devices or personal response devices have now been used for more
 than a decade in various formulations overseas.
 However, they tend to be used at the university level in the United States
 and are often focused on multiple choice questions.
 In any event, as a result of cost and battery drain they are unrealistic
 in the Indian Government school context.

Our approach

I was an academic at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and its predecessor
 the Hong Kong Polytechnic for 25 years till 1997 where I also did volunteer
 work in training teachers of the English Schools Foundation on the use
 of computers when the BBC B first came out in the early 1980's, and have
 served as visiting faculty at universities in Australia, Sweden and China.
 In 1997 I returned to India to work on the issue of educational reform.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While working with children in difficult circumstances in Maharashtra, Andhra
 Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Karnataka - as part of a DFID funded HIV
 project overseen by representatives from DFID, NACO and the United Nations
 Commission for AIDS - I fine tuned and tested our procedures, hardware
 and software.
 We also tested our second generation of feedback devices during these projects
 in short spurts in urban and rural settings.
 There were many insights that were drawn from these experiences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
With a colleague I also worked on the role of Social Equity Audits for NGO’s
 in Tamil Nadu after the 2004 Tsunami, and in Kashmir after the 2005 earthquake.
 We later conducted an evaluation of a Child Rights project in Vietnam,
 in addition to preparing projects ranging from the reduction of MMR and
 IMR in Madhya Pradesh to Child Rights in Burkina Faso.
 These experiences led to new perspectives on the type of education we need
 to adopt.

 During that time, we signed an agreement with the Harvard Graduate School
 of Education to conduct a joint seminar on Mind, Brain and Education with
 a view to informing education policy decision making in India.
 We were also being considered as a research school for HGSE when the owners
 decided to renege on the contract with Harvard and I parted company with
 the school.

Patenting of the innovation

\begin_layout Standard
There is no intention to patent this innovation during this phase.
 The key to this innovation lies in the complex interplay between the structure
 of the program, the content and embedded questions, the assessment methods,
 the representation of the responses, and the analysis of archived performance
 which provides many insights about the student, the quality of delivery,
 the quality of the material etc.
 We look to eventually subsidizing public school services with private sector
 profits and will patent the technology at that stage.

 We came to the conclusion that we had been unsuccessful in defining the
 customer for the product.
 After much consideration we decided that the customer would be an owner-princip
al on the grounds that in private schools only owner-principals were sufficientl
y impacted to want to incorporate this program in their school.
 We made a presentation to 3 schools and two immediately accepted the program.
 In general owners who were not principals were reluctant to modulate an
 existing revenue stream emanating from their school and principals who
 were not owners saw no need to modulate their existing system.
 We made a presentation to three schools and obtained confirmation of interest
 from two.
 We eventually concluded that the Minister for Primary and Secondary Education
 would be the person most likely to see the value of this project.
 In brief we felt that a policy level initiative was needed.
 We tried to work with the Harvard Graduate School of Education to mount
 their MBE program for policy makers but the high cost of the program and
 the absence of government interest combined to thwart this initiative at
 the central level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It has taken us time to devise a plan for working with government and getting
 access to a high enough authority in government to present it to.
 This we did on 7 July 2014.
 A week later during our meeting the Minister personally arranged a meeting
 with Director, DSERT for the same day, where I had an opportunity to present
 our program and its rationale to a DSERT group that included the Deputy
 Director.
 I was informed by the Deputy Director directly after the presentation that
 they would support the program.
 We received the workorder from Director, DSERT on 25 August 2014 for the
 first of the four phases defined in our proposal .

The quality of this product is so far in excess of facilities prevailing
 in government schools that the primary issue is in being able to collaborate
 with government.
 If that happens on any sort of scale, private school participation will
 require little marketing.
 The quality of private schools is not significantly better so the prime
 driver may well be the competition that government schools participating
 in this project create.
 For this reason, it is important to be able to complete the validation
 phase of our project and extend the program to ten government schools in
 Bangalore in the next phase.
 We conducted a Pilot Program with the Maria Niketan School in Bangalore.
 The report of that is available

 schools could generate the investment needed for the commercial enterprise.

The AGEM system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AGEM has developed and tested mechanisms for improving education - through
 small injections of meaningful education - over the last 17 years.
 A key element of the process is the development of individual feedback
 devices for students so that all students even in large classes can be
 active participants in the learning and assessment process.
 These methods and processes have been used in two schools, several NGO
 projects, presentations to principals and professionals, as well as in
 a pilot program for 22 students at a school catering for very poor children.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Key elements of the system include the projection of pre-prepared lesson
 plans with embedded questions which students answer using the feedback
 devices.
 These responses are immediately represented in an appropriate graphical
 summary and projected for the class to see within seconds.
 All responses are stored for archival, analysis, and reporting.

Originality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Few would argue that government schools need to change in order for the
 country to progress but this is a monumental task.
 That important task is hindered by the stranglehold of the examination
 system on the one hand and teacher ability on the other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our system strives to provide a complementary injection of education unencumbere
d by either the examination system or by teacher ability.
 Indeed we would say that the ability to invoke the teacher as a facilitator
 in a externally managed process has scope both for educating the teacher
 into a reformed process and at the same time providing meaningful education
 for large numbers of students.
 When a critical mass of teachers and students have been energised into
 new ways of thinking, the process of educational reform will have begun
 for teachers to recreate in schools the education they have themselves
 experienced.

More specifically, the originality of this innovation stems from:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the purpose built feedback devices - one per student - which are our fourth

 with embedded questions which serve various functions stretching from student
 assessment to lesson plan evaluation.
 This curriculum is designed to develop the skills needed when students
 enter tertiary education or the workplace after a decade.
 Our focus is on making the student a lifelong learner by learning how to
 learn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 immediate summary of the response of each student without identifying the
 student.
 These stimulate conversations that are moderated by the teacher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 each student can identify their own individual responses in the context
 of the class response.
 At the same time confidentiality of the student is maintained.

After 25 years of research, consultancy and training at the Hong Kong Polytechni
c University I came to the realization that poor decision making is most
 often the result of poor educational systems.
 Hence, even in setting up the first school in 1998, I emphasized a questioning
 approach through the inclusion of carefully framed embedded questions in
 pre-prepared lesson plans.
 This was coupled with the deployment of feedback devices which satisfied
 my personal dictum that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

feedback delayed is learning denied
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 When you contrast this with the normal practice where test results are
 delivered days or week after the student has taken the exam, then a few
 seconds delay is exhilarating for students.
 In any event, our questions are variously designed to provide learning,
 assessment or an opportunity to address a different context for what is
 learned.

 Boud and Malloy point out - albeit in the context of higher and professional
 education - that feedback has a double duty.
 The first is,

 We would like to have them ready for testing and student feedback within
 this first validation phase.
 In similar fashion the production of topic plans and the development of
 a distribution technology during this phase will be necessary if one has
 to cater to multiple schools with a school teacher in the classroom as
 opposed to doing it myself.
 These require a level of funding which is the reason for this application.

At the simplest level, feedback devices or classroom response systems come
 in the form of

 These are the the most fundamental of feedback devices but allow merely
 4 to 10 keys which can be used to enter numbers or specify the number of
 an option in a multiple choice quiz.
 This is what we started off with at the first school in 1998 in Bangalore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next level of technology is where there is a wider choice of keys to
 press.
 Hardware in this form can at the simplest level appear like mini keyboards
 with a small screen.
 At the highest level it can take the form of tablets such as the IPad which
 permit Internet access and provide the usual tools for calculation and
 writing.

The case for our current feedback device design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We have found that while free form writing is not needed all the time, it
 does comprise a vital element of the learning process.
 Hence a full keyboard requirement is essential.
 That becomes the first differentiating element of our design against the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clickers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that are in widespread use - but mostly in colleges rather than schools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Battery life is crucial if one is to have large classes and offer this in
 Indian government schools.
 Most of the devices cited above need to be charged once a day or once a
 week.
 We felt that one year is the minimum time between changing batteries for
 our requirement for government schools.
 Our experience is that batteries will last about 2 years in our current
 product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Low cost is an essential element of our requirement.
 The cost of our 5th generation devices which we would produce if this leads
 to mass implementation of our program, would be of the order of USD25 which
 in large numbers could be brought down to USD15 or less.
 For this project we would use our current devices which had a cost of about
 USD50.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Feedback devices such as IPads can also be a distraction in the classroom
 due to their multifunction capacity.
 For this reason, we use a projector to project the content - which comes
 with embedded questions carefully designed to satisfy a specific learning
 requirement - on the wall.
 This permits the class to focus on a single point for content and on their
 feedback devices for entering responses.
 Our current devices do not have displays fitted though the design permits
 such an addition and are very adequate for this project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The design of the feedback devices has been defined by our own needs in
 the classroom.
 These relate to our specific requirements which include:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
viewing the response of upto 256 responders in real time as they type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ability to record the up and down time of each key as it is typed

\begin_layout Enumerate
Multiple Indian languages text entry

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Swype display to allow faster input of text from a smaller keyboard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Monochrome displays
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not expect to achieve all of these incremental attributes during this
 phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary challenges will come from arbitrating between our customized
 hardware design - as was done for the 4th generation devices - and using
 off-the-shelf modules while satisfying the requirement for lower costs.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The overall scope of the proposed program - in the longer term - is to provide
 5-10 hours a week of complementary education to children in government
 schools in the Grade 6-12 segment in Karnataka government schools.
 The content will be designed to help children to learn how to learn, as
 well as to provide them with skills which are readily usable in the post
 school scenario so that each child can be reasonably assured of one of
 the three outcomes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
admission to a tertiary level program in an academic institution
\end_layout

 These 25 units will be the basis for testing the hardware robustness, the
 functional characteristics, and the student comfort with this design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should the government of Karnataka wish to move to the second and subsequent
 phases of the proposed project, such a scalable design will be needed to
 make those phases viable.
 The production can then be carried out with a relatively short delay.
 We visualize about 100 units per school will be needed.

\begin_layout Subsection
The general objective of this project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
India is a land of contrasts.
 No contrast is so glaring as the contrast of wealth, purchasing power,
 and access to health resources.
 Many of these problems stem from access to quality education.
 In our country, government schools, which should be the primary providers
 of education, are giving over that space to private schools through deficient
 delivery.
 In Karnataka the percentage of students going to government schools is
 27% and declining.
 The general objective of this project is to make government schools the
 preferred providers of quality education for 80% of participating communities
 within the decade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the primary symptom of the problem?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to achieve that outcome, the quality of government schools has
 to improve.
 The quality deficit is most apparent in the increasing gap between the
 education that schools provide and the attributes that Industry and academia
 need.This is illustrated most forcefully by the statement by Manish Sabharwal
 that the company he heads - Team Lease - only employs 5% of those who apply
 to it for a job.
 He also says that his company which is also a training company finds that
 40% of those who apply need more than a year of remedial training to qualify.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What are the reasons for the problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Inertia: The education system is hostage to many forms of inertia.
 The most fundamental is that the syllabus cannot easily be altered to meet
 modern needs as it involves retraining teachers, re-writing textbooks along
 with a host of other implications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Scale: Karnataka alone has about 3 million students in Grades 6 to 8.
 It is difficult to use those staff who are part of the current system to
 change the system.
 The sheer scale of the enterprise would require an army of committed reformers
 willing to work to change the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For these and several other reasons, the possibility of reform of the education
 system to meet the needs of industry and academia is not on the cards in
 the near term.
 An essential element of our solution is that we leave these systems more
 or less intact while making education for secondary education more effective
 and more relevant to the needs of academia and industry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the impact of the problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An educational system that is out of step with real-world-needs creates
 several problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Boredom in the student body and the teaching faculty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
High dropout rates which are well known particularly at the Class 5-6 transition
 and the Class 10-12 transition.
 Ultimately only a very small fraction go on to higher education.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Poor quality of undergraduate education.
 If the fundamentals are not formed in the schools, this is a problem that
 will affect the quality of undergraduate education.
 This was forcefully expressed recently by the Vice Chancellor of Delhi
 University who noted that a company which wished to employ a large number
 of of Delhi University graduates ultimately chose only 3 after interviewing
 over one thousand.

One can see from this that if we take the black dashed line as an approximate
 best fit trajectory for India then an increment of 2 years from 4 to 6
 years (yellow dotted lines) leads to an increase in Income per person of
 about PPP$2000.
 However, an increase from 11 to 13 years leads to an increase of about
 PP$20,000.
 This makes the case for women's education specifically and for education
 generally.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

However, the figure above also shows an increase in PPP$ due to the spread
 which some countries, such as Singapore have to the right.
 Singapore in the mid 1960's focused on using school educational quality
 to position itself as a service provider to MNCs.
 It did not invest so extensively in University education till much later.
 More importantly, in the 1990's China modernized its education system to
 change its trajectory to the right thereby generating a higher Income Per
 Person.

The characteristics of the solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Scalability: As the lectures can be delivered over an Internet link there
 is no limit to the number of schools that can receive this.
 However, each school will need one classroom with sufficient feedback devices.
 Large classes are an asset in this system as the quality of representations
 of responses increases.
 Such classes can come from multiple grades within the Grade 6 to 8 and
 9 to 12 segments.

Content: This will centralize content generation to reflect the real needs
 of industry and academia particularly for the future.
 This content complements the content delivered by the school by providing
 learning by methods and practices gleaned from the latest research in neuroscie

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Assessment: The content contains embedded questions which are used for several
 purposes that include assessment.
 This assessment will be centralized and used to improve the content as

\begin_layout Description
Database: This program has the potential to create one of the world's largest
 databases of school performance.
 This has various implications:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
for replacing high stakes examinations due to the large number of questions
 that are answered per lesson varying from about 10 to 30 per hour, thereby
 freeing teachers from following examination constraints and actually using
 that time for helping students learn.
 This will create a better instrument for student development, career guidance
 and evaluation.

\begin_layout Itemize
for integrating new and better methodologies for learning derived from worldwide
 research or culled from the vast database of performance created by this
 system.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Homework: There is no requirement for homework in this system though students
 may be encouraged to do projects and produce a portfolio for employers
 and universities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Textbooks: There are no textbooks required for students on this project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
MOOCs: Many elite universities are today providing educational modules on
 subjects varying from artificial intelligence to entrepreneurship through
 the medium of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs).
 The defining characteristic required to take advantage of this invaluable
 resource is a meaningful education in the teenage years.
 I believe that students graduating from schools deploying the AGEM method
 will be ideal populations to take advantage of the opportunities that MOOCs
 generate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How will impact be measured?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the past we have used placement tests developed and tested in the United
 States for the purpose of measuring academic impact and we will continue
 to do this.
 Past experience has shown that Grade 6 students are below the average level
 of Grade 3 placement tests both in English and Maths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Additionally, in this case, we hope to invoke the expertise of the Harvard
 Graduate School of Education to conduct independent testing for academic
 impact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We also expect to test the impact on the sense of well being of the children.
 For this we intend to use Seligman's CASQ
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire
\end_layout

\end_inset

, WHO-5 and the WEMWBS tests which represent established methods of measurement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In addition, the embedded questions in the topic plans are also used for
 measurement of student response and progress over the duration of the course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, we measure changes in the end of term examinations prior to the
 program and those taken at the end of the program.
 This demonstrates that our students have learned how to learn and will
 therefore see an overall improvement across the board.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the overall design of the study
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Selection of students
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we expect to test the full set of Grades 6, 7 and 8 for the study,
 we will select half the full set to form the experimental group while the
 remainder become the control group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pre and Post testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following tests are envisaged both before the start of the course and
 at the end of the course:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Placement tests for English and Maths conducted by us.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Specific tests for Systems Thinking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tests of explanatory style such as CASQ, WHO-5, and WEMWBS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Conduct of the course
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We expect to conduct this for about 3 hours on Saturday's and about 2 hours
 at one other day in the week.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The topics covered include English, Maths and Systems Thinking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The approach is generally interdisciplinary so a topic plan may cover all
 three disciplines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We generally prefer longer classes to avoid the wastage of time that is
 involved in start up processes.
 Our experience has been that students can take our classes for 5 to 6 hours
 at a time with short breaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We expect students to work on collaborative projects using computers and
 open source software as this is an important element of real-world environments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What are the technology aspects of the project?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Technology in terms of hardware and software is deployed as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Feedback
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

devices: Our fourth generation proprietary feedback devices are wireless
 transceivers interfaced to a keyboard that operates on two AAA batteries
 which last for about 2 years in normal operation.
 We log details of any instance when any key is pressed or released.
 The current version is the 4th generation of hardware and we have a fifth
 generation planned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Software: Software is deployed at multiple levels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Embedded software provides the hooks for us to interface with the keyboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Interfacing software is written in C and provides low level access to the
 data streams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Application software is written in Perl and provides the interface for managemen
t of the feedback devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Representation and analysis is done in R and generates the graphics that
 are displayed for the students after they have responded to a question.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Distribution
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Hardware: If multiple schools are being catered for, then a centralized
 studio will be required to broadcast content to multiple locations.
 However, control signals will also need to be broadcast to permit the opportuni
ty for students keyboards to be activated.
 This process will also require a server in the classroom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Initial Pilot Program in Maths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2010, I decided to conduct a Pilot Program to measure the effectiveness
 of the process we had defined for improving government schools.
 As working with government is a complex process we decided to work with
 the Maria Niketan School in Bangalore which caters to the needs of the
 economically deprived.
 The results of that 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "work"
target "www.agem.in/pdf/BriefReport.pdf"

\end_inset

 convinced me that a process of low profile injection for 5 hours a week
 would be adequate to make government schools the preferred schools for
 80% of participating communities.
 This represents a low profile approach to reform which does not face the
 inherent resistance of the current system.
 This resistance is greater in government schools though it is significant
 also in private schools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Proposed costs and time frame for the project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Expenditure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principal objective of many of these expenditures is the need for creating
 a more effective design for the later phases of the rollout culminating
 in the introduction of this equipment, delivery and incorporation of responses
 into a centralized database of performance for all government schools in
 Karnataka.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Total
\begin_inset space ~

sought: 18.535 lakhs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Rationale for buying rather than hiring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The leasing of electronic equipment is an expensive option.
 For instance, the daily hire of a projector is about Rs.
 1500 per day.
 For the two sessions required per week for twenty weeks this would amount
 to Rs.
 60,000.
 The cost of a new projector with higher specifications would be about Rs.
 50,000 or less.
 There is better value in re-selling after the program is over than there
 is in leasing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the computer laboratory, it is most likely that the school would
 acquire it.
 If not these devices can be sold for abut one third of the price.
 In any event, leasing low cost devices such as Raspberry Pi's is not a
 viable commercial option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Fifth Generation Feedback devices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The justification for this is cited in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Technological-challenges-in"

\end_inset

.
 The cost of this development for 25 units is expected to be of the order
 of 6 Lakhs, with the objective to design a device that can be manufactured
 at a cost of USD30 or less.
 This estimate would include the driver software as well as the application
 software to the specifications broadly detailed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
